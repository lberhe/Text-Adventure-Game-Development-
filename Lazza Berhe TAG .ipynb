    "    A) Introduction:\n",
    "    This game was created inorder to challenge your brain against simple questions that may seem complex while putting you under pressure as the Death God is trying to take you away. It consists of three stages, and also has defined functions\n",
    "    for stages, giving up, and failing also includes a bonus. This game requires some thought, and being patient will be helpful.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Your goal is to get past the the three rounds without either failing or giving up. If you manage to complete all three stages as well as the bonus, you will be able to be revived and will be granted one wish. \n",
